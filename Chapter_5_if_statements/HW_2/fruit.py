# Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of
# independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
# Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits
# Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit
# is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print
# a statement, such as You really like bananas!

# list
favorite_fruits = ['dragon fruit', 'apple', 'kiwi']
# check to see if value is in list with if statements
if 'dragon fruit' in favorite_fruits:
