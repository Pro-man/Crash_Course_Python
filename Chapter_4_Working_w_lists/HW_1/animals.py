# Think of at least three animals that have a common characteristic.
# Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop
# to print out the name of each animal.
# Modify your program to print a statement about each animal
# Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals 
# have in common. 

# create list
animals = ['lions', 'cheetahs', 'tigers', 'jaguars']
# for loop to go through list
for animal in animals:
    print(animal)
    print(animal.title() + " are good hunters.\n")

print("All these animals are large cats and live in the wild.")
