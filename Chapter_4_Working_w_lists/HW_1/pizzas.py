# Store three pizzas names in a list, and then use a for loop to 
# print the name of each pizza.
# Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza. 
# Add a line at the end of your program, outside the fdor loop that states
# how much you like pizza.


# create a list
pizzas = ['supreme', 'chicken', 'cheese']
# for loop to display pizza name in a sentence
for pizza in pizzas:
    print("I like " + pizza + " pizza.")

# this print statement is outside the for loop
print("I really love pizza.")
